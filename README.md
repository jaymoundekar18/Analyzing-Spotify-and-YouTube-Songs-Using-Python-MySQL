# Analyzing-Spotify-and-YouTube-Songs-Using-Python-MySQL

This project aims to provide a practical learning experience in the analysis of real-world databases using SQL, with a focus on maximizing insights from the dataset. It also covers the essential step of pre-processing data using Python to enhance future performance. Structured Query Language (SQL) will be utilized to retrieve valuable information from the database.

The project is structured into two modules:

Module 1: Data Pre-processing with Python

Module 2: Data Analysis using SQL

These modules collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of how to efficiently manage and extract insights from a database, making it a valuable learning opportunity.
